P1-Trainee Feedback Management System This is a project to provide the rating for the trainer based on his/her batch and according to question section. My module is Feedback Management from the entire project. In this module you can log in as an admin/associate/trainer. I've implemented all the user stories mentioned into the common backlog. Such as, as admin I should be able to see all trainers rating,as Associate I should be able to give feedback to trainer, as Trainer I should be able to see only my rating. Technologies used to achieve this module are Core Java, JDBC, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Servlets, JSP for the module. To set up the project you need Eclipse latest version and MySQL 8.0.31. Tables should be created in order to access jdbc functionalities and operations. One can use this project to provide a rating system for the trainer and teachers over any teaching platforms or schools and colleges to get a smooth user user experience and get a better idea about the changes to be made. The contributiors for this module are myself for now,as the module will progress and merge with other modules the contributiors will be listed accordingly.
